    "1. Identify the task to be performed correctly, and only then proceed to write the required code. Don’t perform any incorrect analysis or look for information that isn’t required for the assignment.\n",
    "2. In some cases, the variable names have already been assigned, and you just need to write code against them. In other cases, the names to be given are mentioned in the instructions. We strongly advise you to use the mentioned names only.\n",
    "3. Always keep inspecting your data frame after you have performed a particular set of operations.\n",
    "4. There are some checkpoints given in the IPython notebook provided. They're just useful pieces of information you can use to check if the result you have obtained after performing a particular task is correct or not.\n",
    "5. Note that you will be asked to refer to documentation for solving some of the questions. That is done on purpose for you to learn new commands and also how to use the documentation."
