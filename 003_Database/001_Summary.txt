In this session, you learnt the following:

* What a data warehouse is
* The differences between a data warehouse and a transactional database
* OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems are Subject-oriented, Integrated, Non-volatile and Time-variant
* A data warehouse provides an integrated view of the entire organisation and the data is organised for carrying out analysis efficiently
* Facts and dimensions and how to arrange them in order to design a data warehouse
* Dimension tables act as metadata, which is data about data, and enhance the facts table to enhance the insights from the data
* What a star schema is
* The advantages of having a star schema in a database
* The SETL process: Select, Extract, Transform and Load
* The different types of constraints: Entity, Referential and Semantic constraints
* ERDs and their constituents

================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
In this session, you learnt how to set up a schema and make it ripe for analysis using various DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements in MySQL.
The DDL statements are:

CREATE
ALTER
DROP

The DML statements are:
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
SELECT
 
While Data Definition Language statements are used to alter the structure of a database, Data Manipulation Language statements are used to change the data itself that is present inside the database.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
In this session, you understood the crux of SQL queries. These are the basic concepts of SQL, which will be tested rigorously in your interviews. Hence, we urge you to practise all you can and develop a deep understanding of the various SQL statements.
Now, you learnt that a complete query (in a sense) has the following basic outline:

select (attributes)

from (table)

where (filter_condition)

group by (attributes_to_be_grouped_upon)

having (filter_condition_on_grouped_values)

order by (values)

limit (no_of_values_to_display);

 

You also learnt about the following important concepts related to basic SQL querying:
* Relational, arithmetic and logical operators
* Aggregate functions
* Regular expressions
* Nested queries
* Common Table Expressions
* Views
* Advantages of views over CTEs
