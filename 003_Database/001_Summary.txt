In this session, you learnt the following:

* What a data warehouse is
* The differences between a data warehouse and a transactional database
* OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems are Subject-oriented, Integrated, Non-volatile and Time-variant
* A data warehouse provides an integrated view of the entire organisation and the data is organised for carrying out analysis efficiently
* Facts and dimensions and how to arrange them in order to design a data warehouse
* Dimension tables act as metadata, which is data about data, and enhance the facts table to enhance the insights from the data
* What a star schema is
* The advantages of having a star schema in a database
* The SETL process: Select, Extract, Transform and Load
* The different types of constraints: Entity, Referential and Semantic constraints
* ERDs and their constituents

================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
In this session, you learnt how to set up a schema and make it ripe for analysis using various DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements in MySQL.
The DDL statements are:

CREATE
ALTER
DROP

The DML statements are:
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
SELECT
 
While Data Definition Language statements are used to alter the structure of a database, Data Manipulation Language statements are used to change the data itself that is present inside the database.
